## "What is this?"

First of all, I want to explain typescript to my friends, so there are a lot of proposital errors and portuguese comments inside every single file.

This is a repository where I learn typescript and pass the knowledge on to my fellas. Who dont have time to study for several hours in a row like I do.

Also, I need to learn because I will work with it in some days, so I have to learn fast.

## How can I see the results of each .ts file?

First you will need to clone the repo.

After this, you can run `npm install`. Once the packages are downloaded, run `npx tsc <filename>.ts` to compile the file and generate a `<filename>.js`. After that, if the folder have a html file, you need to install `live server` to see the results in the browser (if necessary, link the html with the script generated). But if have only a .js file, type `node <filename>.js` and press enter.

## "The code sucks! There is errors in everyline"

As I said, the main purpose of the repo is not running the code. Because the main show is the comments, where I try to briefly explain what everything is doing. Also, my type of learning and teaching is making things work after commiting into several erros.

I'Ã§l admit that at the start point, my goal was not to do this. But I changed my mind because I want to see my friends with a nice job and working with something that they love. So I'll do this sacrifice for them.
